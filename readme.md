Features
Multi-Step Configuration Process: Guided workflow through requirements gathering, specifications, performance analysis, and product comparison
Real-Time Performance Calculations: Instant feedback on how specifications affect product performance
Interactive Visualizations: Clear graphical representation of performance metrics
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
Database Integration: Persistent storage with PostgreSQL (with in-memory fallback)
Technical Stack
Frontend:

React with TypeScript
TanStack Query for data fetching
Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
Wouter for routing
Backend:

Express.js server
Drizzle ORM for database operations
PostgreSQL database (with in-memory fallback)

Summary: Final results and detailed specifications
Database Structure
The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:

users: User authentication and profiles
product_categories: Categories of industrial products
application_types: Specific applications within each category
products: Detailed product specifications and performance data
Getting Started
Clone the repository
Install dependencies with npm install
Set up environment variables:
DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string
Start the development server: npm run dev
Development Notes
The application features a fallback to in-memory storage when a database connection is not available
Real-time calculations are performed on the server based on user input
The UI features custom animations, gradients, and responsive design for an enhanced user experience
Future Enhancements
User authentication and saved configurations
PDF report generation for configured products
Enhanced visualization with 3D product models
